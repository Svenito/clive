  "body": "### This is CLIve\r\nReddit live feeds are a great way to keep current with events as news unfolds. The drawback is that you need to keep a webpage open which can take up a significant amount of screen space. CLIve solves this issue by streaming Reddit live feeds to your terminal in a nice, compact, and simple way.\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n\r\n![CLIve in action](http://i.imgur.com/M4XjDJp.png)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nAll CLIve really needs is the name of the feed, which is the last part of the live feed URL. For example, if the URL for a feed is: `https://www.reddit.com/live/wl2tprwm3v4m/`, you will need to pass `wl2tprwm3v4m` to CLIve.\r\n\r\nThe only other option is `-w` or `--width`, which defines the maximum width to format the text to. This defaults to 70.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* Python 2.7/3.5\r\n* Requests\r\n* Websocket-client\r\n* colorama\r\n* html (for <= Python 2.7)",
